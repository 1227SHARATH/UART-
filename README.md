UART Design Code, Testbench, and Output Reports

This repository contains a Verilog/VHDL implementation of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART). The design includes a configurable baud rate generator, transmitter, and receiver modules. The testbench verifies the functionality of the UART through various simulations, ensuring accurate data transmission, reception, and error detection.
 Output Reports:
- Area and Gate Report: Provides details on gate count and area utilization after synthesis.
- Timing Report: Includes pre-layout timing analysis to verify setup and hold times, along with maximum clock frequency and critical path delays.
- Schematic Diagram: A schematic visualization from the synthesis stage, showing the gate-level structure of the design.

This project is suitable for FPGA implementation and can be integrated into larger embedded systems.
